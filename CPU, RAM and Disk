1/ CPU:
- Core: The physical component of a CPU. Each core includes a Control Unit (the captain), arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and register (just like RAM). More core better 
- Thread: Instruction (which is code) that can be executed per core ( normally 1 core 2 thread). Programer and dev care about this
- hz: Speed of cpu. 2.9 Ghz = 2.9 billion work per second => the more the clock, the better
- CPU bus: there is two types: data bus and address bus. Bus is used to transmit data between CPU and RAM (thats why it is called bus). CPU input address to address bus and RAM return data via data bus.
